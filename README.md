# Optimize images and videos
Optimize images and videos inside folders and subfolders

This is a simple script that can optimize images and videos (reduce size) for
whatever reason you'd like to do so.

I used pillow and ffmpeg, so you have to install both.

For ffmpeg, you'll have to change the ffmpeg path according to your system 
platform in the "ffmpeg_command" function.
